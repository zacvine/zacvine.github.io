                            My project idea is to develop a front-end application for Facebook. The application will access information from the users Facebook account and then make it accessible to the user in a way which address current concerns about online health and safety when it comes to using social applications. The program could be installed by parents to help protect and monitor their children or simply by individuals who wish to have access to a social platform without having to put up with so many negative connotations. Although a PC or Macintosh version could potentially be useful, the main purpose of this application would be to help limit and manage the time individuals spend on their phones.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Although there are monitoring software solutions available, I feel that using such software could not only be time consuming (imagine reading all the texts two teenagers have written to each other) but could negatively impact parent-child relationships. I believe Shwartz, 2019, said it best when he quite correctly states “by relying on cyber-spying, we allow ourselves to do things that we would have never tolerated from our own parents. For example, them reading our private journal would have been absolutely off-limits.” Still, I believe there needs to be some safeguards in place to offer a level of protection online, while still allowing younger children and teens, to maintain their privacy. That is where my app idea comes from. Although alternative social network platforms have been created especially for children, it is my hypothesis that due to the Facebook market share, most younger individuals will still want access to this specific platform.<br></p>

                        <h4 class="mbr-step-title pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">Description of Project Features</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Below is a list of some of the key features I would incorporate into the app. At the moment this is just an initial list and I expect it to grow and change as and if the project matures…
<br>
<br><em><strong>ALGORITHMS TO HIDE OFFENSIVE/BULLYING POSTS &amp; COMMENTS:<br></strong></em>To make an immediate dent in needless or possibly offensive comments, when filtering information to display, the app will only allow the user to view comments which have been left by a user on their friend list. For older users this setting could potentially be turned off. After that an algorithm would be used to determine that the comment is of the correct nature, this algorithm could be adjusted based on user settings, for example, it could remove any swearing for younger children, but for older children focus more on the nature of the swearing. For example, have the algorithm use surrounding words to determine if it is abusive towards someone as opposed to just being “a bad word”. Even older users could choose to just leave all their friend’s comments entirely un-filtered. 
<br>
<br><em><strong>SAFER FRIEND REQUESTS:
<br></strong></em>The credit for one function I would want to incorporate goes to another social media platform designed specifically for children. Effectively, for a friend request to be visible, BOTH users would need to send a request. This would ensure that children were only making and accepting friend requests from people they already had direct contact with. Older users would be able to turn this off if they wished.
<br>
<br><strong><em>RELEVANT &amp; SUITABLE NEWS FEED:<br></em></strong>Targeted advertising, following celebrities and the ability to see and hear friend of friends, combined with the new relevancy algorithm used by Facebook instead of a standard timeline (Villas-Boas, 2019), means not only are children being subjected to irrelevant and possibly damaging information, but older users are required to sift through so much irrelevant information to “stay in the loop”. Our app would filter and show only posts made directly by friends, it would filter out advertising, business and celebrity pages. To help protect against “fake-news” it would also filter out “shares”. Comments would be visible, but again, only comments made by users on the viewers friends list. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>FILTERED NOTIFICATIONS:<br></em></strong>For Antonio Villas-Boas the final nail in the Facebook coffin was the new relentless notifications coming through to his phone. Notifications such as “a high-school friend who I hadn’t spoken with in years commenting on a random person’s photo”, which were not just annoying but blocking potentially useful notifications underneath (Villas-Boas, 2019). My front-end application would filter notifications to be relevant and in-line with parental or user settings. They could also be timed to only come through at set intervals, such as once daily, this could help negate the need to constantly check one’s phone and feed for updates. You could even take this one step further by removing the visibility of “likes” on posts entirely as well as the ability for the user to “like” posts made by others.
<br>
<br><em><strong>MESSENGER FUNCTION &amp; ACCOUNT SECURITY:&nbsp;<br></strong></em>The app would need to have its settings password protected so that younger users couldn’t change their filter settings without parental consent. It would be for the same reason that Facebook account details would not be accessible within the app meaning children would not have access to their Facebook login details to use elsewhere. When pulling information from Facebook, the app could also analyse comments and information in friends posts to see if there was any sign of a younger user having set-up another user account. The Messenger function could be enabled or disabled, or even set to be enabled at certain times. For example, the function may be available outside school hours or for an hour before bedtime.<br></p>

                            The hardware required for this project would be little, perhaps nothing past the PC used to develop the application. Physical data-storage would not be necessary as the application will be developed using Facebook API’s to pull all information directly from their server. At this time, I am unsure what, if any, hardware resources would be required to run the application as smoothly as possible. I anticipate, at a minimum, there will be internal memory requirements so that when information is pulled to the device, it can be analysed and filtered before being displayed.&nbsp;Analytics programs would be used to track downloads, user engagement and retention for the app once active.<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                            Design skills to come up with the outlay and “look and feel” of the app would be needed. This person need not have coding experience, this stage could be done on something as simple as pen and paper. If the building and coding of the app is not going to be simply outsourced, we would need someone with experience in coding applications for both google and apple and who was also capable of integrating the application with Facebook. They would also need to be up to the task of designing and compiling the filtering algorithm. Someone would need to have a registered developer account with the respective app stores to make the app available to the masses as well as for posting updates.

<br>1.	In a few years when my daughter comes home and asks me to let her have a Facebook account because all her friends do, I can safely say yes without breaching her trust by spying and without worrying about her online safety.
<br>2.	People who want to use Facebook, as a means of communication, to stay in the loop, without having to worry about filtering through advertisements, likes, comments by friends of friends, silly shared posts and fake news, and maybe just want a way to wish there nan a simple happy birthday, they can easily do so.&nbsp;<br></p>
