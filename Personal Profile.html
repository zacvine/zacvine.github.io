They can also be described as easygoing, selfless, guarded, adaptable, patient and loyal.</p><p><em>Images courtesy of Personality Max, 2019</em></p></div>

                        <h4 class="mbr-step-title pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">What the results mean to me:</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">16 Personalities, 2019, states the INFP personality type as being Open-Minded, Flexible, Passionate, Energetic, Dedicated and Hard-Working. I found this to be a positive and somewhat accurate representation of myself which has filled me with confidence for achieving my educational goals. On a more personal note, they also define me as difficult to get to know, private, reserved and self-conscious. I also found this to be right on the money as sometimes I struggle with sharing ideas, thoughts and personal things about myself. This has hindered me somewhat in my Online education as it takes me a long time to go over what it is I am typing and sharing with the class or sometimes even results in me sharing nothing at all. This is something that I am focusing on at the minute.
<br>
<br>Having a pre-dominantly visual learning style could prove to be very beneficial in an online learning environment as everything is done on a computer screen. I was however surprised that although I had a predominantly visual learning style my multiple intelligences test would suggest that my visual intelligence is comparatively very low.
<br>
<br>Personality Max, 2019, suggests that people with intrapersonal intelligence are adept at looking inward and figuring out their own feelings, motivations and goals. This does sound like me and I enjoy constantly trying to better myself through various methods of self-improvement. &nbsp;<br></p>

                        <h4 class="mbr-step-title pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">How these results may influence my team behaviour:</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">16 Personalities, 2019, suggests individuals of my personality type often take challenges and criticisms personally while at the same time avoiding conflict with others as much as possible. This could potentially lead me to harvest an unnecessary animosity towards team members if my feelings aren't kept in check. The silver-lining to this trait is that INFP personality types will put a great deal of time and energy into trying to align their principles and the criticisms of others into a middle ground that satisfies everybody. 
<br>
<br>Both my Myers-Briggs type test and my multiple intelligences test would suggest that I am quite an introverted individual (Personality Max, 2019). As such, it will be important that I make sure to not keep all my opinions and ideas to myself and that I make myself heard amongst the team. This could also be affected by the individuals within the group I'm working with.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <h4 class="mbr-step-title pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">How should these results be taken into account when forming a team:</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">16 Personalities, 2019, states my personality type as feeling most comfortable among colleagues – we aren’t interested in controlling others. This would suggest that I would need to form a team where someone else can take on the leadership role, however, as the INFP personality type has a similar distaste for being controlled (16 Personalities, 2019), it would be important that the individual playing the leadership role is suited to leading my personality type.  As subordinates, my personality type would much rather immerse themselves in a project than just be told what task to do and move on and would much rather hear what they did right and focus on what to do, rather than what not to do (16 Personalities, 2019).
<br>
<br>Being a predominantly visual learner suggests that I have a talent for not only accurately recognizes body language and facial expressions but also learning from video presentations (Personality Max, 2019). One could hypothesise from this that I would work better in a team using a chiefly video (or visual) based communication system as opposed to a purely auditory one.
<br>
<br>A high level of Intrapersonal Intelligence would suggest a good ability to work well alone (Personality Max, 2019). So perhaps being in a group where at least a part of my role is something I can work on independently.&nbsp;<br></p>
